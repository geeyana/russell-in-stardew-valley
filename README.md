## 📋 Overview

Stardew Valley is a pixelated farming game developed by ConcernedApe. Popular for its slice-of-life vibe and players' ability to start a life with the townsfolk, another attribute to the game (aside from maintaining a farm) is getting to own pets (namely dogs in this case).

I made this mod for fun and to get started with modifying Stardew Valley and games as a whole. This utilizes Stardew Modding API ([SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)) and [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) to change the game's assets without replacing its files. 

Spritesheet for this comes from [another dog mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20040). I editted the sprites to reflect my dog's characteristics.
